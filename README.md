DPS-task- contact List
This is a contact list management app. It was coded purely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The app includes three pages, the first page is to login so each user has access to his/her own contact list. 
The second page is to add new contacts including: first name, last name and email. The fields cannot remain empty also duplicate emails are not accepted. 
The second page also has a button to direct the user to the list of the contacts.
The third page shows the contact list and enable the user to delete or edit the contacts. 
New version with less bug and cleaner structer comming soon.
